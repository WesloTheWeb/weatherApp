# Weather App
In an effort to improve and grow as a software engineer at work and on my freetime, this project was started on November 8th, 
2021. I mainly wanted to instill some of the new habits and knowledge I gained at work, which includes, but not limited to:
- Taking advantage of NextJS features and dynamic routing
- Writing Unit Tests
- Incorporating new techniques and act as a snapshot in time of my current project.

Overall I am pretty happy about this project and can confidently say this will be a CI/CD (continous integration / continous deployment). The API I am using is well documented.

## To-Do:
Cool potential features:
- âœ” <s>Accomplish main functionality of querying for weather related data</s>
- Mobile responsiveness at some point.
- Make release branch and live version of the site.
- Smooth transitions to improve the UX flow.
- Background change to the time of day and weather (may need to find royalty free asset).
- A history users can shift through from latest searches.
- Moving background or animations.
- Distinctive fonts for typography.
- An actual name for the weather app.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
